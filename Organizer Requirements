Organizer Requirements
----------------------

The purpose of the Organizer application is to help solve the problem of keeping items organized in a way that is easier to manage. Since there are so many items to worry about in life, having organized lists for any need is really useful.

Organizer should be an application that allows its users to create a list of items, whatever those items may be, and have those items be organized by a set of rules the user creates. The lists themselves (Organizations) can be anything the user wants. 
An example is:

	-The user wants to create a shopping list
	-The user wants to create a list of workouts the user has done for the week. 
	-The user wants to create a list that contains other organized lists (A recipe is a list of items needed cook a meal. A list of recipes is then a list of lists). 

Every list should be able to use a ruleset that the user creates. These rules need to be re-usable and easily added.
Examples of rulesets would be:

	-Shopping List -> Create Rules that Organize by type of item (Produce, Canned Goods, Dairy, Utilities, etc...)
	-Shopping List -> Create Rules that can organize other rules (Show me produce first, then dairy, then canned goods, etc...)
	-Workout Sets -> Create Rules that show me my weekly workouts first
	-Workout Sets -> Create rules that shows the workout done the most
	-Workout Sets -> Create Rules that organizes by distance traveled, then by calories burned, etc...
	-TODO List -> Create Rules that organize lists into one list 
	-TODO List -> Create Rules that order the lists by frequency (How often the user checks an item off the list)
	-Etc...

The application should allow users to sign up, log in, and see lists that the user has previously saved with the rulesets that the user has saved.
